# BasicQuestionnaireAnalysisTool
 A very basic version of questionnaire analysis tool, a very cut-down version of SPSS. Got help from Chat-GPT while doing this.

<h3>With Template Function:</h3> 
Combines the all the data in a single excel and separates each question to different spreadsheets. 

<h3>Without Template Function:</h3> 
Outputs the data of the questions into separate files in the output folder.

This project is very basic, so please do not expect much from it. 

Thank you if you ever checked it out!
